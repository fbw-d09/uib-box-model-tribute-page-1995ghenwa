          It was only a smile, nothing more. It didn't make everything all
          right.<br> It didn't make ANYTHING all right. Only a smile.<br> A tiny thing.
          A leaf in the woods, shaking in the wake of a startled bird's flight.<br>
          But I'll take it. With open arms. Because when spring comes,<br> it melts
          the snow one flake at a time, and maybe I just witnessed the first
          flake melting. - Amir
